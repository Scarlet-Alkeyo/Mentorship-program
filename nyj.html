        <h1>BORN A CRIME</h1>
      Born A crime by Trevor is memoir that revist his happy,sad,humorous,and sometimes,heatbreaking memories while  hewas growing.Patricia was a  mother of Tervor.His father was called Robeart.Trevor says that he wass 
      boren as a crime because his mother was ablack.Black and white were not allowed to have sexual intercourse.If they were found the black woman will judge  but the man the will just assume maybe he was drunk.One of the
       issues that stood out for me  was humor as a capacity of mechanism.A young-year-old Trevor never had to think about his
      qustion nor did he have a choice of jumping out of a moving vehicle.The book begins with a rather horrifying but funny incident.One Sunday
      evening,his mother pushed him out of a moving speeding minibus before she threw  herself out after him.In that intance,jumping from a moving vehicle
      held more appeals than the horrors that awaited them at the end of the ride.As it was ,apartheid had seen to it that all tribes especially the zulu and
      the Xhosa were divided.After they were safe after running for a long time,Trevor asks her mother why she never woke him up.He says that even if the driver
      and the rest of the people wanted to kill him,they would have  woken him up before killing him.His mother tells him that they have to safe their lives first.
      It is very intersting conversation between Trevor and his mother since they were just joking even if they had escaped from danger.
      Another intance of humor is when  Trevor tells that sometimes he could be sent to the shop and go to play with other kids.His mother could come and starts 
      running after him.Trevor says that no woman could ran as fast as his mother.whenever his mother  saw that Trevor ran fast he could scream a thief  and people 
      could catch him . I can relate it in our county when village parents beat their children so bad running the whole village.Everbody will  know that the child has done something wrong.
      
      Ther existed immorarity Act,a law that was  passed that  black people should not have sexual intercourse.There are people who still had sexual intercouse despite
      not of the same race.I can relate this that thre are people who normally have sexual intercouse to gain money.This is a form  of immorarity.They preffer money than 
      dignity.</p>
