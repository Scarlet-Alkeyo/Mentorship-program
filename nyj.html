        <h1>BORN A CRIME</h1>
      <p>Born A crime by Trevor is memoir that revist his happy,sad,humorous,and sometimes,heatbreaking memories while  hewas growing.</p>
      <p>Patricia was a  mother of Tervor.His father was called Robeart.Trevor says that he wass boren as a crime because his mother was a</p>
      <p>black.Black and white were not allowed to have sexual intercourse.If they were found the black woman will judge  but the man they </p>
      <p>will just assume maybe he was drunk.</p>
      <p>One of the issues that stood out for me  was humor as a capacity of mechanism.A young-year-old Trevor never had to think about his</p>
      <p>qustion nor did he have a choice of jumping out of a moving vehicle.The book begins with a rather horrifying but funny incident.One Sunday</p>
      <p>evening,his mother pushed him out of a moving speeding minibus before she threw  herself out after him.In that intance,jumping from a moving vehicle</p>
      <p>held more appeals than the horrors that awaited them at the end of the ride.As it was ,apartheid had seen to it that all tribes especially the zulu and</p>
      <p> the Xhosa were divided.After they were safe after running for a long time,Trevor asks her mother why she never woke him up.He says that even if the driver</p>
      <p>and the rest of the people wanted to kill him,they would have  woken him up before killing him.His mother tells him that they have to safe their lives first.</p>
      <p>It is very intersting conversation between Trevor and his mother since they were just joking even if they had escaped from danger.</p>
      <p>Another intance of humor is when  Trevor tells that sometimes he could be sent to the shop and go to play with other kids.His mother could come and starts </p>
      <p>running after him.Trevor says that no woman could ran as fast as his mother.whenever his mother  saw that Trevor ran fast he could scream a thief  and people </p>
      <p>could catch him .</p>
      <p>I can relate it in our county when village parents beat their children so bad running the whole village.Everbody will  know that the child has done something wrong.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Ther existed immorarity Act,a law that was  passed that  black people should not have sexual intercourse.There are people who still had sexual intercouse despite</p>
      <p>not of the same race.I can relate this that thre are people who normally have sexual intercouse to gain money.This is a form  of immorarity.They preffer money than </p>
      <p>dignity.</p>
